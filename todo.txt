check max output mA on 5v to see if suitable to power antenna
    needed or no?
figure out multiple network time servers that support iburst NTS
    fiugre out what this means
        server nts.anastrophe.com iburst nts maxsamples 1

fiugre out/test pps1 and pps0
figure out configing the ffuckin thing in uthing
    increase the baud rate
        boot-firmware-config.txt /boot/firmware/config.txt
        gpsd /etc/default/gpsd
/boot/firmware/config.txt
    baudrate 9600
    pps pin 23
stop each service
    bash ~/Precision-Timekeeping-Fuckery/services.sh stop
start one by one to see any errors
    try first
        bash ~/Precision-Timekeeping-Fuckery/services.sh start
    otherwise
        sudo systemctl start gpsd
        sudo systemctl start chrony
        sudo systemctl start influxdb
